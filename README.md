## Overview

Welcome to MetaMarket, an innovative convergence of retail and digital technology within the burgeoning landscape of the metaverse. MetaMarket represents a groundbreaking concept: a virtual supermarket where businesses vie for prime shelf space, not through traditional means, but through a decentralized, blockchain-based bidding system.

### The Concept

Imagine a digital marketplace, accessible from anywhere in the world, where the dynamics of physical retail are replicated and enhanced in a virtual environment. Here, businesses can showcase their products on virtual shelves, reaching a global audience. The twist? These shelves are bid on and rented via a digital currency, designed specifically for MetaMarket.

### Blockchain Integration

At the core of MetaMarket is blockchain technology. We utilize the Ethereum blockchain, leveraging the power and flexibility of ERC20 and [ERC4907](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4907) tokens. The ERC20 token serves as the backbone of our economic model, facilitating transactions, bidding, and governance. Meanwhile, we explore the potential of ERC4907 tokens to represent rentable shelf spaces, a novel approach marrying the concept of NFTs with practical, revenue-generating utility.

### Governance Through DAO

Central to MetaMarket's ethos is decentralization, not just in technology but in governance. A Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) steers the project, ensuring that every stakeholder has a voice. This DAO is responsible for maintaining the platform, overseeing development, and making critical decisions about the future of MetaMarket.

### Bridging the Virtual and Real Worlds

MetaMarket is more than a digital platform; it's a bridge between the virtual and real worlds. By allowing purchases with USDT, which is seamlessly converted to our native currency, we ensure ease of transaction for users accustomed to traditional e-commerce platforms.

### The Vision

Our vision is to create a metaverse ecosystem that transcends traditional e-commerce, offering an immersive, interactive, and inclusive shopping experience. MetaMarket is where the future of retail meets the potential of blockchain, creating a unique, decentralized marketplace for the digital age.

In the following sections, we delve deeper into the technology, tokenomics, and operational mechanics of MetaMarket, laying out our roadmap for revolutionizing the retail experience in the metaverse.

## Technology Stack

### Blockchain

For the sake of decentralization, transparency, and security, MetaMarket is built on the Ethereum blockchain. We utilize the ERC20 token standard for our native currency, which is used for all transactions, bidding, and governance. We also explore the potential of ERC721 tokens to represent rentable shelf spaces, a novel approach marrying the concept of NFTs with practical, revenue-generating utility.

Blockchain in this case could be thought of as the backend of an e-commerce platform, handling all transactions and data storage. However, unlike traditional e-commerce platforms, the blockchain is decentralized, ensuring that no single entity has control over the platform. This is achieved through a DAO, which is responsible for maintaining the platform, overseeing development, and making critical decisions about the future of MetaMarket.

We are using Polygon as a Layer 2 solution to reduce gas fees and increase transaction speed. This will allow us to scale the platform to millions of users, while also ensuring that transactions are fast and cheap, making the platform accessible to everyone.

### Metaverse Platform

The metaverse platform is the frontend of MetaMarket, providing the user interface for the platform. This is where users can browse the virtual supermarket, view products, make interactions with their products and also meet real people and experience the real shopping experience where **people are more prone to show interest or to buy something that other people want.**

### DAO

The DAO is the governing body of MetaMarket, responsible for maintaining the platform, overseeing development, and making critical decisions about the future of MetaMarket. The DAO is comprised of all stakeholders, including us as co-founders, developers, and investors.

Regular calls are made to discuss the direction of the project, and all stakeholders are encouraged to participate. Decisions are made through a voting system, with each stakeholder having a vote proportional to their stake in the project.

Anyone, **including the general public** can become a stakeholder by purchasing our native currency. This is a key aspect of MetaMarket's ethos: **decentralization and inclusivity.**

## Tokenomics

MetaMarket, by itself cannot survive without a viable business model. The tokenomics of MetaMarket is designed to ensure that the platform is sustainable and profitable, while also providing value to all stakeholders.

The goal here is to create value from the platform, which will be reflected in the value of the native currency. This value will be derived from the following sources:

-   **Bidding:** Businesses will bid for shelf space, which will be paid in our native currency.

-   **Rentals:** Businesses will pay rent for their shelf space, which will be paid in our native currency.

-   **Transactions:** Users will purchase products, which will be paid in USDT. This USDT will be converted to our native currency, which will be used to pay rent and bidding fees.

-   **Staking:** Users will be able to stake their currency, earning rewards in the form of our native currency. This will create demand for the currency, driving up its value.

-   **DAO Governance:** DAO members will be able to vote on proposals, which will be paid in our native currency.

### Currency Token ([ERC20](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20))

The currency token is the backbone of MetaMarket's economic model, facilitating transactions, bidding, and governance. It is an ERC20 token, which is the most widely used token standard on the Ethereum blockchain. This ensures that the currency is compatible with most wallets and exchanges, facilitating interoperability and ease of use.

Our ERC20 token (MMT) will have a fixed supply of 1 billion tokens. This will ensure that the currency is not subject to inflation, which would devalue the currency and reduce its utility. The currency will be divisible to 18 decimal places, allowing for microtransactions and ensuring that the currency is not subject to deflation.

### Conversion Mechanism

The general public are more familiar with USDT than any other cryptocurrency. Therefore, we will allow users to purchase products using USDT, which will be seamlessly converted to our native currency before reaching the seller. This will ensure ease of transaction for users accustomed to traditional e-commerce platforms but also allow us to create value from the platform.

As for the sellers, their assets will be locked in the smart contract until the buyer confirms the transaction. This will ensure that the seller receives payment for their products, while also protecting the buyer from fraud and ensuring decentralized government.

### Distribution and Allocation

The currency token will be distributed through an initial coin offering (ICO), which will be conducted through a smart contract. The ICO will be open to the general public, allowing anyone to purchase our native currency. This is a key aspect of MetaMarket's ethos: decentralization and inclusivity.

The currency token will be allocated as follows:

-   **ICO:** 40% of the currency token will be allocated to the ICO, which will be open to the general public.

-   **Team:** 20% of the currency token will be allocated to the team, which will be used to fund development and operations.

-   **DAO:** 20% of the currency token will be allocated to the DAO, which will be used to fund governance and maintenance.

-   **Marketing:** 10% of the currency token will be allocated to marketing, which will be used to fund marketing and promotion.

-   **Incentives:** 5% of the currency token will be allocated to incentives, which will be used to reward users for their participation in the platform.

-   **Reserve:** 5% of the currency token will be allocated to the reserve, which will be used to fund future development and operations.

## Bidding Process and Shelf Space Allocation

The bidding process is the heart of MetaMarket's economic model, ensuring that the platform is sustainable and profitable. Businesses will bid for shelf space, which will be paid in our native currency. The bidding process will be conducted through a smart contract, which will ensure that the process is fair and transparent.

The bidding process will be conducted as follows:

-   **Bidding:** Businesses will bid for shelf space, which will be paid in our native currency.

-   **Allocation:** The smart contract will allocate shelf space to the highest bidder, ensuring that the process is fair and transparent.

The duration of the bidding process and the allocation (rental) period will be determined by the DAO.

## Rentable Shelves as NFTs

We are exploring the potential of ERC4907 tokens to represent rentable shelf spaces, a novel approach marrying the concept of NFTs with practical, revenue-generating utility.

ERC4907 are very similar to ERC721 tokens, with the extension of user allocation for a certain period of time and with a pre-determined expiry date.

## Legal and Regulatory Considerations

MetaMarket is a decentralized platform, which means that it is not subject to any jurisdiction. However, we will comply with all applicable laws and regulations, including KYC/AML requirements.

We hope, that in the future, MetaMarket will be able to operate in a fully decentralized manner, without any legal or regulatory restrictions and we think that this will be possible with the rise of ZK-Rollups and the widespread adoption of blockchain technology with digital identity.

## Future Roadmap

MetaMarket is a long-term project, with a roadmap spanning several years. Our goal is to create a metaverse ecosystem that transcends traditional e-commerce, offering an immersive, interactive, and inclusive shopping experience.

The following is a high-level overview of our roadmap:

-   **Phase 1:** Launch an alpha version of the platform as an MVP, allowing the idea to be tested and validated by the community.

-   **Phase 2:** Get partnerships with major brands and retailers, allowing them to showcase their products on the platform. Marketing and promotion during the hype are the incentives for the brands and retailers to join the platform.

-   **Phase 3:** Launch a beta version of the platform, allowing users to purchase products using USDT.

-   **Phase 4:** Launch a full version of the platform, automating the bidding process and shelf space allocation.

-   **Phase 5:** Launch a mobile app, allowing users to access the platform from anywhere in the world without the need for a VR headset.

We could not project more than this since the metaverse is still in its infancy and we do not know how it will evolve in the future. However, we are confident that MetaMarket will be able to adapt to any changes in the metaverse ecosystem since it is inherently adopting a real-world like experience.
